- 👋 Hi, I’m @levymc
- 👀 I’m interested in process automations using Python (Web Scraping - Selenium) databases and libraries (a little RPA too), web applications with Python Back End (Flask/Django) and other fun projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, Flask, Javascript, ReactJS and NextJS.
- 💞️ I am looking for process automation projects and web applications.
